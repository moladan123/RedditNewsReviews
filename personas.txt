Elly (Typical User):
    Caucasian, female, currently completing a degree in biology.
    Currently is a student at the university of Toronto and has
    a lot of studying for her midterms coming soon. She knows how
    to use technology, but wants it to work in a way that saves her
    precious time. She wants to use this system to figure which Highway
    would be the best one to go on to minimize the amount of time commuting

Bob (Application Developper):
    Bob is 25 years old and just recently began on his career as a
    software developper. He isn't very good however, and prefers it
    when other people's api work without too much research on his end
    he relies a lot on documentation and other people's code
    so sometimes he messes up and ends up DOSing some of the api's
    that he works with.
